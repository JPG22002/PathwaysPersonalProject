## Project Overview

### Title: Netflix Pathways Project (Formation Version)

#### Background
This project was inspired by the Netflix Pathways program, specifically the Netflix x Formation sub-program. While I didn't have the opportunity to participate in a project during the program, I took the initiative to create my own, based on the rubric provided for a peer's group project. This endeavor represents not just a technical challenge but also a personal commitment to growth and learning in the field of software development.

#### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to independently conceptualize, design, and implement a software solution that aligns with industry standards. The project showcases key aspects of software development, including problem-solving, code efficiency, and adaptability to given specifications.

#### Key Features
- Comprehensive implementation of MVC architecture.
- Efficient database management and querying using advanced Java frameworks.
- Implementation of RESTful APIs for seamless front-end and back-end integration.
- Robust error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure reliability and data integrity.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface design (if applicable).

#### Technologies Used
- Java: For core backend development.
- Spring Boot: Simplifying the setup and development of new Spring applications.
- Maven: Dependency management and project build.
- RESTful Services: For API development.
- Additional libraries and frameworks relevant to the project (e.g., Hibernate, JUnit).

#### Personal Initiative
This project is a testament to my ability to take initiative and lead my learning journey. Without a formal group or direct guidance, I embraced the challenge to build a project that not only meets the prescribed criteria but also reflects my understanding and skills in software development.
